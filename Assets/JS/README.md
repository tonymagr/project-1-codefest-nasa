## TRAILER-PHONE (A Web-based movie lover's application)##

#DESCRIPTION

A web application that gives you interesting details about movies, and a built in function that pulls up the trailer for that movie when given a year for that title.

#USER STORY

As a lover of movies, I want to be able to see interesting information about movies such as the actors in the film, the name of the director, and the country of origin. 

I would also like to be able to get information as to whether or not a movie I am unfamiliar with might be worth watching. For this, I need the IMDB rating, the plot, the and an easily accessible trailer to watch.

As a user, I am also very busy with school, work, children, etc. so I need other relevant information such as run-time and rating.
