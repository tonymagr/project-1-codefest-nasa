Well, TrailerPhone has all the details and resources you need to make those decisions more quickly and find a movie that you will love. TrailerPhone gives you relevant details about a movie and pulls up the trailer from YouTube instantly so you can get started watching instead of scrolling through choices. 


#DESCRIPTION

A web application that gives you interesting details about movies, and a built in function that pulls up the trailer for that movie when given a year for that title.

#USER STORY

As a lover of movies, I want to be able to see interesting information about movies such as the actors in the film, the name of the director, and the country of origin. 

I would also like to be able to get information as to whether or not a movie I am unfamiliar with might be worth watching. For this, I need the IMDB rating, the plot, the and an easily accessible trailer to watch.

As a user, I am also very busy with school, work, children, etc. so I need other relevant information such as run-time and rating.
